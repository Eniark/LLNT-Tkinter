# Law of Large Numbers

During my studies of probability I came across an interesting thing - the law of large numbers. I was often fascinated by programs that simulated this law. So I decided to make my own using python.

_This program is supposed to simulate a toss of a fair coin (50% chance for heads and tail equally) and display results on a dynamic plot._
