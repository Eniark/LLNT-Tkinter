# Law of Large Numbers

This is a python program to demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers using Tkinter and Matplotlib.

During my studies of probability I came across an interesting thing - the law of large numbers. I was often fascinated by programs that simulated this law. So I decided to make my own using python.

This program simulates a toss of a fair coin (50% chance for heads and tail equally) and displays results on a dynamic plot.
